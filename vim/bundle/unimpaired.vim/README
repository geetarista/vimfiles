Much of unimpaired.vim was extracted from my vimrc when I noticed a pattern: complementary pairs of mappings.  They fall into three categories.

There are mappings which are simply short normal mode aliases for commonly used ex commands. ]q is :cnext. [q is :cprevious. ]a is :next. [b is :bprevious.  See the documentation for the full set of 16 mappings and mnemonics.  All of them take a count.

There are linewise mappings. [<Space> and ]<Space> add newlines before and after the cursor line. [e and ]e exchange the current line with the one above or below it.

There are mappings for encoding and decoding. [x and ]x encode and decode XML (and HTML). [u and ]u encode and decode URLs. [y and ]y do C String style escaping.

Oh, and there's also [o and ]o to go to the next/previous file in the directory.
